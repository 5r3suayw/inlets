## Intro

inlets&reg; combines a reverse proxy and websocketÂ tunnels to expose your internal and development endpoints to the public Internet via an exit-server. An exit-server may be a 5-10 USD VPS or any other computer with an IPv4 IP address. You can also tunnel services without exposing them on the Internet, making inlets a suitable replacement for a VPN.

Why do we need this project? Similar tools such as [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) or [Argo Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/argo-tunnel/) from [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) are closed-source, have limits built-in, can work out expensive, and have limited support for arm/arm64. Ngrok is also often banned by corporate firewall policies meaning it can be unusable. Other open-source tunnel tools are designed to only set up a single static tunnel.

With inlets you can set up your own self-hosted tunnel, copy over the static binary and start tunnelling traffic without any arbitrary limits or restrictions. When combined with TLS, inlets can be used with most corporate HTTP proxies.

## About inlets

inlets uses a websocket to create to create a tunnel between a client and a server. The server is typically a machine with a public IP address, and the client is on a private network with no public address.

inlets is considered production-ready, but you should do some testing before you depend on it, or use [inlets PRO](https://inlets.dev/) which is commercially supported.

### Private or public tunnels?

* A public tunnel is where you expose the private service to users via the server's public IP
* A private tunnel is where you start a tunnel to a server and only expose it on the server's LAN address

### Features

* Tunnel HTTP or websockets
* Client announces the tunnelled services to the server
* Expose multiple sites on same port through the use of DNS entries and a `Host` header
* Upgrade to link encryption using TLS for websockets (`wss://`) with an external add-on, or [inlets PRO](https://inlets.dev)
* Shared authentication token for the client and server
* Automatic reconnects for when the connection drops

Distribution:

* Binaries and Docker images for multiple architecture - Intel and ARM
* Kubernetes YAML files and Dockerfile
* systemd unit file for client/server
* Native Kubernetes Service and LoadBalancer integration with [inlets-operator](https://github.com/inlets/inlets-operator)

### Going to production with inlets PRO

The following features / use-cases are covered by [inlets PRO](https://inlets.dev):

* Tunnel L4 TCP traffic such as websockets, databases, reverse proxies, remote desktop and SSH
* Expose multiple ports from the same client - i.e. 80 and 443
* Run a reverse proxy or Kubernetes IngressController directly on your host
* Automated TLS for the control-plane
* Commercial services & support
* Documentation, blog posts, tutorials and videos

### inlets projects

inlets is a Cloud Native Tunnel and is [listed on the Cloud Native Landscape](https://landscape.cncf.io/category=service-proxy&format=card-mode&grouping=category&sort=stars) under *Service Proxies*.

* [inlets PRO](https://inlets.dev) - Cloud Native Tunnel - TCP, HTTP & websockets with automated TLS encryption
* [inlets-operator](https://github.com/inlets/inlets-operator) - Public IPs for your private Kubernetes Services and CRD
* [inletsctl](https://github.com/inlets/inletsctl) - The fastest way to create self-hosted exit-servers
* [inlets](https://github.com/inlets/inlets) - Cloud Native Tunnel for HTTP only - configure TLS separately, not available for inletsctl or inlets-operator

## Get inlets

You can install the CLI with a `curl` utility script, `brew` or by downloading the binary from the releases page. Once installed you'll get the `inlets` command.

### Install the CLI

> Note: `inlets` is made available free-of-charge, but you can support its ongoing development and sign up for updates through [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/alexellis/) ðŸ’ª

Utility script with `curl`:

```bash
# Install to local directory
curl -sLS https://get.inlets.dev | sh

# Install to /usr/local/bin/
curl -sLS https://get.inlets.dev | sudo sh
```

> Note: the `brew` distribution is maintained by the brew team, so it may lag a little behind the GitHub release.

Binaries are made available on the [releases page](https://github.com/inlets/inlets/releases) for Linux (x86_64, armhf & arm64), Windows (experimental), and for Darwin (MacOS). You will also find SHA checksums available if you want to verify your download.

Windows users are encouraged to use [git bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads) to install the inlets binary.

## Using inlets

### Video demo

Using inlets I was able to set up a public endpoint (with a custom domain name) for my JavaScript & Webpack [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Quickstart tutorial

You can run inlets between any two computers with connectivity, these could be containers, VMs, bare metal or even "loop-back" on your own laptop.

Try the [quickstart tutorial now](./docs/quickstart.md) on your local computer.

### Documentation & tutorials

inlets and inlets PRO have their own documentation site:
